                <h1>SM24</h1>
                <p>Scotland / March / 2024. When a photo is taken, the light that hits the sensor is now light from the past. This means that a photograph is essentially a document of a memory. If the photograph captures the light truthfully then the photograph is more integral than a memory. Memories alone can become distorted. This investigation explores my photography as reflections of memory rather than representations of reality.</p>
