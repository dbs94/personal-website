                <h1>WAX ON PAPER</h1>
                <p>Wax on Paper explores themes of fate and control. Each piece of paper begins its journey by getting scrunched up. The wax reveals the unique marks created by its fate. The application of wax is also an element of control. The process is fast and chaotic.</p>
