                <h1>F24</h1>
                <p>Flowers / 2024. This series further investigates the fine line between painting and photography. I see my photographs as paintings painted by light, allowing the natural, unpredictable world in front of me to inform the composition of the canvas. This series, in particular, explores the world of flowers.</p>
