                    <p>This morning I decided to sit down and meditate on my surroundings. It led me to my body and how I experience life in the first place. I realised there is this interesting area that sits between the physical world we inhabit and the space only the mind can perceive. They are our senses. A thread that connects the mortal to the immortal, and living creatures to their gods. Senses are a universal law and transcend across many forms of life. For us this law gave us five. Five ways to see the world and five ways to make things be seen. However, a sense can only sense itself once it has a mind. And a mind void of senses is nothing more than a void filled with the unknown.</p>

                    <p>To see sound, I use my ears.
                    <br>To see smells, I use my nose.
                    <br>To see temperature, I use my skin.
                    <br>To see flavours, I use my tongue.
                    <br>To see objects, I use my eyes.</p>
                
                    <p>To see ideas, I use my mind.</p>

                    <p>In the Cambridge dictionary the meaning to sixth sense is as follows: â€œan ability that some people believe they have that seems to give them information without using the five senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste."</p>

                    <p>I think the sixth sense is our mind and we all have this ability.</p>
