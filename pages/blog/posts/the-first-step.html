                    <p>I don’t consider myself a writer. I never have done. But I do consider myself as a person that has retained their inner child. The world still keeps me curious, and I still keep pointing my finger and asking the question “why…”.</p>
                    
                    <p>I’ve created this blog so I can write freely about ideas. To try to learn about the world and understand myself better. I’m grateful for the history of thinkers that have lived before me and for inspiring me to use my own voice too. I’ve come to realise that the greatest thing we can do in life is to reason.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since turning 30 I want to explore my thoughts and see how they evolve over the years. I see this as nothing more than a personal blog to myself yet I am allowing it to be open to the eyes of the public. I’m not sure why. Maybe to inspire others to use their voice too. Or maybe it’s a way to keep my writing as clear as I can. I think one aspect is that it scares me and I’ve always believed that fear is a good thing. I think I’ll run with that last option.</p>
